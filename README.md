My first Godot project

This project was really good introduction to working with Godot as I see potential in what this game engine could be used for (mobile games). I am still however trying to fix my project as I wanted to have a start menu where you press a button to start the game but I could not get the game to start playing when you hit the button and for the button to dissapear. Not sure how to fix it if you have any suggestions peer reviewer that would be greatly appreciated. However I did get the score and lives to update with the help of our most recent excercise showing me the way. I hope we get a chance to review this assignment and add more to it. 

EDIT: NOW THE BALL IS NOT REAPPEARING AFTER IT FALLS OFF PLZ HELP.
